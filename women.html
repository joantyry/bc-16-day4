                        <h4>MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS VS REALITY</h4>
                        Coding has been made to look like a mans thing. Over the years this has 
                        been a male dominated field,all due to this misconceptions.Women are faced
                        with unfair competition and are made to believe they cant make it. There
                        is nothing as hurting like walking into an institution with a male counterpart 
                        and he gets the job which you are equally qualified just because of this myth "women
                        don't know how to code or if the know they are poor at it." I believe when a
                        women puts her heart towards something she does it to her level best no matter what
                        it takes. Women in technology are even better than men in the same field. Believe in yourself,
                        you can make and nothing should shutter away your dream. Another thing that hurts is this group 
                        of ladies who believe men should do it, and never make any effort to become better. They just sit
                        around and wait for manna to drop from heaven. Some of them bring other women down who strive for excellence.
                        Wake up its never too late to achieve your dreams. Go for it, own it.<br>
